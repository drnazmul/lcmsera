    "text": "Hey there! Let’s talk about the different ways scientists separate compounds in liquid chromatography (LC). There are two main methods: isocratic and gradient.\nIsocratic separation just means using a constant mixture of solvents to separate compounds. It’s pretty straightforward and easy to do, but it might not always give the best results.\nGradient separation, on the other hand, uses a changing mixture of solvents to improve the separation process. This can lead to better peak shapes and faster analysis times. When scientists are developing a gradient mixing method, they can use either a binary or quaternary pump.\nBinary pumps mix solvents at high pressure, which is great for high-pressure gradient (HPG) analysis. Quaternary pumps, on the other hand, mix solvents at low pressure."

    "text": "Binary pump or High Pressure Gradient Pump\nDo you know what is the difference between binary and quaternary pumps?\nBinary pumps are the most popular pumps used in high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). They are known for their ability to create gradients using two solvents. They’re perfect for high-throughput and high-resolution (U)HPLC, or LC-MS applications.\nSo, how do binary pumps work? Well, they use two pump blocks and two solvent inlet lines to mix two individual solvents at high pressure. The two solvents are mixed in a mixing chamber after the pump heads, creating a high-pressure proportioning environment. This means that the solvents are already under pressure before they reach the mix-point where the mixing occurs.\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s say you’re running a method that uses Solvent A and Solvent B at a ratio of 70:30. If your flow rate is 1.0 mL/min, the pumps would deliver 0.70 mL/min for Solvent A and 0.30 mL/min for Solvent B.\nBinary pumps are great for routine and high-throughput applications that require a two-solvent gradient. They’re easy to use and can be controlled using software. Plus, they’re capable of creating complex gradients that can be changed over time."

    "text": "What Is a Quaternary Pump or Low Pressure Mixing (LPM) pump\nHey there! Today, I am going to talk about quaternary pumps. These pumps are used for separating different substances efficiently. The cool thing about them is that they can use up to four solvents for gradient separation.\nBasically, these pumps mix the solvents at low pressure, which is why they’re sometimes called low-pressure mixing (LPM) pumps or low-pressure gradient (LPG) pumps. Don’t worry if these terms sound confusing, they all mean the same thing.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, what is a quaternary pump? It’s a pump that uses up to four different solvents to create gradients. These pumps are great for method development or when you need flexibility in your mobile phase composition. They use a single pump block and four solvent inlet lines to mix the solvents. The first plunger withdraws the solvents under low pressure, while the second plunger pushes an accurate flow rate under high pressure into the system. The mixing of the solvents occurs inside the first plunger cylinder, or a mixer can be installed after the proportioning valve in some designs. But, what’s a proportioning valve? It’s a fancy piece of equipment that opens the valve of each solvent to deliver an equivalent amount to the pump heads. As an example, Let’s say you’re a scientist, and you need to mix solvent A, B, C, and D in equal parts. The proportioning valve would open the valve of each solvent to deliver an equivalent sized packet of solvent to the pump heads.\nSince these pumps use low-pressure mixing to create gradients. This means that solvent degassing or the use of a vacuum degasser is necessary. The pumps can be controlled by software and offer the flexibility to change the composition of the mobile phase over time. They’re perfect for scientists who need to run methods with different solvent ratios. So, why are these pumps so great? Well, they’re perfect for separating complex mixtures because they can use different solvents to create a gradient that separates the different substances. This means that you can get more accurate results and save time.\nAnother thing that’s awesome about quaternary pumps is that they’re really versatile. They can be used in a variety of industries, from pharmaceuticals to food and beverage.\nOne of the drawbacks is that they have a higher dwell volume. This means that it takes longer for the system to re-equilibrate after each sample is completed. It’s like waiting for a pot of water to boil - it takes longer if there’s more water in the pot.\nAnother issue with LPMs is that the extra dwell volume can create an isocratic hold if it’s not taken into account during a method transfer. This can cause problems down the line, so it’s important to be aware of it.\nIn summary, both binary and quaternary pumps have their pros and cons. It’s up to you to decide which one is best for your specific needs. But now you know a little more about these pumps, and that’s always a good thing!"

    "section": "",
    "text": "The history of liquid chromatography dates back to the early 1900s when Russian botanist Mikhail Semyonovich Tswett invented a method for separating plant pigments using petroleum ether. He called this new technique “chromatography” because the result of the analysis was literally “written in color” along the length of the adsorbent column.\n Forty years later, Archer John Porter Martin and Richard Lawrence Millington Synge published a new type of partition chromatography that used silica gel in columns to separate amino acids, which led to the development of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). In the 1970s, HPLC instruments saw significant improvements in technology, with the ability to develop up to 6,000 psi of pressure and incorporate improved injectors, detectors, and columns.\nFurther advances in instrumentation and column technology were made in 2004 to achieve ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) technology, with columns containing even smaller 1-micron-diameter particles and instrumentation capable of performing at 100,000 psi. Today, laboratories worldwide use HPLC to identify and quantify non- and semi-volatile chemical components in liquid samples.\nThe evolution of liquid chromatography has come a long way, with continuous research and development leading to significant improvements in performance, resolution, speed, and sensitivity. With the introduction of UPLC and UHPLC, the pressure race continues, providing a glimpse of what we may expect in the future.\nReferences:\n\nRonald E.

    "text": "Pumps are mechanical devices that transfer mobile phases from low-pressure reservoirs to high-pressure areas in the system. Their primary function is to maintain a constant flow of the mobile phase through the system, regardless of back pressure caused by flow resistance.\nReciprocating pumps, which are a type of positive displacement pump, are commonly used in (U)HPLC systems. There are two basic designs of reciprocating pumps: piston and plunger. Plunger pumps are the most commonly used in (U)HPLC systems, but some instrument vendors may use piston designs. It is important to note that the two types are not interchangeable, although instrument documents may mistakenly label them as such.\nIn plunger pumps, a smooth cylindrical plunger slides through a stationary high-pressure seal. In contrast, piston pumps have a high-pressure seal that reciprocates with the piston. Understanding the differences between the two designs is crucial for proper use and maintenance of (U)HPLC systems."

    "text": "Mechanism of Action: Understanding Reciprocating Pumps\nAs we have learned about the differences between plunger and piston-based pumps, let’s delve into the mechanism of action of a reciprocating pump. A pump typically consists of a cylinder with a piston or plunger inside, along with check valves at the inlet and outlet. For the purpose of this explanation, we will focus on the plunger design, but the same mechanism of action applies to piston-based pumps as well.\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring the suction stroke, the plunger moves to the right (see the figure), causing the chamber inside the cylinder to expand. This expansion results in a drop in pressure, which opens the suction valve and allows fluid to enter through the inlet. The check valves prevent the fluid from flowing back and direct it through the pump. As the suction valve opens, the discharge valve closes.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the discharge stroke, the plunger moves towards the left (see the figure), pushing the fluid in the cylinder and increasing the pressure. This pressure increase closes the suction valve and opens the discharge valve, allowing the fluid to exit the pump. This process repeats continuously, resulting in a steady flow of fluid through the pump.\nOverall, the reciprocating pump’s mechanism of action is straightforward and efficient, making it a popular choice for applications that require precise and consistent flow rates, such as in (U)HPLC systems."

    "section": "Mechanisms for Driving the Pumps: Crankshaft vs. Camshaft",
    "text": "Mechanisms for Driving the Pumps: Crankshaft vs. Camshaft\nIn a pump, the piston or plunger is responsible for creating the pressure difference that moves fluid through the system. To achieve this, the piston must be driven with a motor. There are two primary mechanisms that can be used to drive the piston: a crankshaft or a camshaft.\nA crankshaft is a simple mechanism that is commonly used in industrial applications. It is connected to an electric motor and rotates to generate the reciprocating motion of the piston. The crankshaft is connected to a connecting rod, which in turn is connected to the piston. As the motor turns the crankshaft, the connecting rod moves back and forth, causing the piston to move in and out of the cylinder.\nIn some pumps, the motor may be directly connected to the piston/plunger, eliminating the need for a crankshaft and connecting rod. This approach is often used in smaller pumps where simplicity and compactness are critical.\n\n\n\n\n\nA camshaft is another mechanism that can be used to drive a piston pump. It uses a series of cams to generate the reciprocating motion of the piston. The cams are mounted on a rotating shaft and are shaped like oblong circles. The shape of the cam determines the timing and speed of the piston’s motion.\nCamshaft-driven piston pumps are often used in applications where precise control of flow rate and pressure is required. The camshaft can be adjusted to change the shape of the cams, which in turn changes the motion of the piston. This allows for fine-tuning of the pump’s performance. However, camshaft-driven pumps can be more complex and expensive than crankshaft-driven pumps, so they are not as commonly used in industrial applications.\nIn conclusion, the choice of mechanism for driving a piston/plunger pump will depend on the specific requirements of the application. Crankshaft mechanisms are more commonly used in industrial applications due to their simplicity and lower cost, while camshaft mechanisms are often used in research and analytical applications, especially with UHPLCs, where precise control of flow rate and pressure is required.\nNotes:\nPumps-mechanism\nSeal and Plunger\nCam vs Crank\nPlunger change - Agilent"

They consist of a ruby ball and a sapphire seat that are lapped to ensure a tight seal when the ball is resting on it. The valves operate based on pressure and gravity to open and close.\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite their importance, check valves are often the least reliable parts of the pump. The most common design includes a ruby ball and sapphire seat that are slightly ground or “lapped” to match the curvature of the ball for better sealing. When the pressure beneath the check valve is higher than above it, the ball is lifted from the seat, allowing solvent to flow through the hole in the seat. When the pressure is equal on both sides of the valve or higher on the top, the ball settles onto the seat, providing a seal.\nInlet check valves are more prone to sticking than outlet check valves because of the pressure within the pump. To address this issue, many pumps now feature “active” check valves on the pump inlet. These valves use mechanical assistance, such as a spring and solenoid-actuated lifting device, to ensure proper seating and prevent sticking. The active check valve design is more reliable and is not subject to sticking when using acetonitrile.\nIt is worth noting that the inlet check valves of many modern UHPLC pumps use active check valves, regardless of whether the in-parallel or accumulator-plunger design is employed. This ensures consistent and reliable performance, critical for accurate and precise separation and analysis in chromatography."

    "text": "The pump seal\nThe pump seal is an essential component in preventing leakage of the mobile phase and air from entering during filling. It consists of a polymeric ring that encircles the plunger with a groove containing a spring on the high-pressure side. The spring helps to create a better seal by pulling the lip of the seal against the piston. The high liquid pressure in the pump chamber also aids in pushing the lip of the seal against the surface of the plunger, acting like a squeegee to keep the mobile phase within the pump chamber. Although the sealing process is not perfect, it allows a thin film of mobile phase to remain on the plunger surface, lubricating the plunger-seal interface and preventing premature wear of the seal. Proper maintenance and replacement of the pump seal are crucial for optimal performance and longevity of the pump."

    "section": "Single-Plunger Reciprocating Pumps",
    "text": "Single-Plunger Reciprocating Pumps\nThe basic design of a pump for early LC systems featured a single piston or plunger in the pump head, making it a single-piston/plunger pump. Its flow rate was controlled by adjusting the piston stroke with a large micrometer mounted on the pump. This type of pump was compact, affordable, and continuously delivered, making it a staple in HPLC solvent delivery. However, the pulsed flow caused by the piston recharge cycle was a weakness of the single-piston reciprocating pump.\nThe single-acting pumps displaced only one volume of the mobile phase per cycle, resulting in large pulses in flow and pressure. This was not ideal for maintaining a constant flow and even pressure, which was necessary for satisfactory detector performance. Early HPLC systems addressed this issue by including pulse dampers, while later designs incorporated shaped driving camshafts and variable-speed motors to reduce the fill portion of the pump cycle and improve delivery smoothness. Despite these improvements, the flow and pressure challenges inherent in single-piston pumps were not completely resolved."

    "section": "Dual piston/plunger pumps",
    "text": "Dual piston/plunger pumps\nDual-plunger pumps are a solution to the issue of flow and delivery pulses in single-plunger pumps. These pumps are widely used today and come in two types: in-parallel and in-series.\n\nDual-plunger in parallel\n\n\n\n\n\nIn-parallel pumps use two pumps that operate 180° out of phase to counteract the pulses of a single-plunger pump. These pumps are driven by a single cam, with one pump head filling while the other delivers. The output of the pumps is combined to ensure a constant flow, making them highly effective in LC pump design. Although less common in the analytical pumps market, dual-piston in-parallel pumps have been reintroduced in some UHPLC pumps, such as the Shimadzu AD models and the Thermo Vanquish pumps.\n\n\nDual plunger in-series\nThe dual-plunger in-series pump, also known as the accumulator plunger design, is commonly used in modern (U)HPLC systems. It consists of two plungers, with one delivering a single or mixed solvent to the other, known as the high-pressure plunger or accumulator. The two plungers have different displacement volumes and deliver at different rates, allowing for accurate compositional control and less pulsation. The pump has three check valves - an outlet, an inlet, and a middle check valve that acts as an inlet check valve for the top plunger and an outlet check valve for the bottom plunger. In one cycle, the top plunger delivers 1 mL/min to the column, with the outlet check valve open and the middle check valve closed, while the bottom plunger fills at 2 mL/min with an inlet check valve open and the middle check valve closed. In the alternate cycle, the bottom plunger delivers at 2 mL/min, with 1 mL/min serving to fill the top piston and the other 1 mL/min flowing to the column. Thus, 1 mL/min of mobile phase always flows to the column.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe accumulator plunger pump is preferred for its highly accurate compositional control and less pulsation, making it a popular choice for many (U)HPLC systems. It is used in various systems, including Agilent’s 1100, 1200, and 1260 with single motor design, Agilent 1290 with independent plunger drives, and Waters Alliance and Acquity UPLC instruments with independent plunger drives. The pump design has only three check valves, which is argued by manufacturers to enhance reliability compared to the dual in-parallel design. Additionally, the accumulator plunger pump usually has only one traditional ball-type check valve between the two plunger chambers, as there is no need for an outlet check valve since either the top or bottom plunger is always supplying flow to the column."
